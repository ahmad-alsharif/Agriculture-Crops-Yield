# Agriculture Crops Yield
#### - [Project Dataset]()

This project investigates the impact of rainfall and temperature on crop yield using R. By analyzing data on these environmental factors and their correlation with crop productivity, the study aims to identify optimal conditions for maximizing yields. The findings will provide actionable recommendations for farmers and suggest strategies for mitigating the effects of extreme weather conditions, contributing to more sustainable agricultural practices.

#### ֎ Analysis outcome:
♦ *Total yield is strongly affected by rainfall (0.7680389).* <br>
♦ *The affect of temperature on total yield is minimal (0.08402748).* <br>
♦ *Harvesting days are not affected by rainfall (0.0003817865).* <br>
♦ *Harvesting days are not affected by temperature (0.005686612).* <br>
♦ *Optimal Rainfall amount for high yield: 154.5653 mm .* <br>
♦ *Optimal Temperature for high yield: 15 °C.* <br>
